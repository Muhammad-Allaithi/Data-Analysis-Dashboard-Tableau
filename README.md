# Electric Vehicle - Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Tableau)
## Project Objective
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing EV adoption trends by model year, state, and manufacturer. Visualized top EV models, CAFV eligibility, and geographical distribution, highlighting key market insights. Demonstrated proficiency in data visualization and reporting.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/Muhammad-Allaithi/Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau/blob/main/ELECTRIC%20VEHICLE%20DATA%20ANALYSIS.twbx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the average electric range of EVs?
- How many total electric vehicles (EVs), BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles), and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) are there?
- Which EV make and model are the most popular?
- What is the distribution of EVs across states?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/Muhammad-Allaithi/Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-15%20155355.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Data Aggregation.
- Descriptive Analytics.
- Data Visualization:
  * Line graph showing EV growth over time by model year.
  * Bar charts representing top vehicle makes and models based on total count.
  * Map visualization highlighting the distribution of EVs by state.
  * Pie chart displaying vehicle eligibility status for CAFV incentives.
- Interactive Filtering.
- Dashboard Interactivity.
