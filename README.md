# Electric Vehicle - Data Analysis (Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Tableau)
## Project Objective
Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard analyzing EV adoption trends by model year, state, and manufacturer. Visualized top EV models, CAFV eligibility, and geographical distribution, highlighting key market insights. Demonstrated proficiency in data visualization and reporting.

## Dataset Used

- <a href="https://github.com/Muhammad-Allaithi/Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau/blob/main/ELECTRIC%20VEHICLE%20DATA%20ANALYSIS.twbx">Dataset</a>

## Questions (KPIs)

- What is the average electric range of EVs?
- How many total electric vehicles (EVs), BEV (Battery Electric Vehicles), and PHEV (Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles) are there?
- Which EV make and model are the most popular?
- What is the distribution of EVs across states?

- Dashboard Interaction <a href="https://github.com/Muhammad-Allaithi/Data-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-15%20155355.png">View Dashboard</a>

## Process

- Data Aggregation - Data was grouped and aggregated by variables like vehicle make, model, year, and state to derive key insights.
- Descriptive Analytics - Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Vehicles, Total BEV Vehicles, and Total PHEV Vehicles were calculated, alongside Average Electric Range. This provided an overview of the data for quick insights.
- Data Visualization:
  * Line graph showing EV growth over time by model year.
  * Bar charts representing top vehicle makes and models based on total count.
  * Map visualization highlighting the distribution of EVs by state.
  * Pie chart displaying vehicle eligibility status for CAFV incentives.
- Interactive Filtering - The dashboard allows users to filter data by CAFV Eligibility, EV Type, Model, and State to view specific insights tailored to user queries. This makes the dashboard flexible and responsive to various data exploration needs.
- Dashboard Interactivity - Add filters (CAFV eligibility, state, model, EV type) to make the dashboard interactive, allowing users to drill down into specific insights.

## Project Insights

- Average Electric Range.
- EV Distribution by Model.
- Top Manufacturers.
- Top 10 Vehicle Brands.
- Growth in EV Adoption.
- CAFV Eligibility Analysis.
- Geographic Concentration.

## Final Conclusion

The "Electric Vehicle Data Analysis" dashboard reveals a comprehensive overview of the EV landscape. Tesla dominates the market, with its Model Y and Model 3 being the most popular. The average electric range is 67.83 miles, which may influence EV adoption depending on user needs. There has been consistent growth in EV adoption, peaking in 2023. A significant portion of EVs remains either CAFV ineligible or their eligibility is unknown, highlighting potential for expanding clean energy incentives. Overall, the data reflects growing interest and investment in electric vehicles across various states and manufacturers.
